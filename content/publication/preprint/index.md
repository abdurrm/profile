abstract: As energy conservation in Wireless Sensor Networks is crucial, the scheduling methods are required to ensure that sensor nodes operate for a longer period. Duty cycle scheduling can be accomplished using synchronous, asynchronous, or on-demand methods with additional radio channels. This study has integrated the on-demand method with an asynchronous scheduling mechanism for the wake-up radio. Model simulation results with random placements showed that the Wake-up Asynchronous On-demand Radio Duty-Cycle (WAORDC) method was able to achieve the latency value of 3.3 seconds, better than the CXMAC asynchronous method, and the total energy required was approximately 4% only, to activate the sensor node.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Effective scheduling is crucial for energy conservation in Wireless Sensor Networks. This study combined on-demand and asynchronous scheduling for wake-up radios. The WAORDC method achieved a 3.3-second latency and used only 4% of the energy, outperforming the CXMAC method.
